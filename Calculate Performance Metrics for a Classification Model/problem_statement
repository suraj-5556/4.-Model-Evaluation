Task: Implement Performance Metrics Calculation
In this task, you are required to implement a function performance_metrics(actual, predicted) that computes various performance metrics for a binary classification problem. These metrics include:

Confusion Matrix
Accuracy
F1 Score
Specificity
Negative Predictive Value
The function should take in two lists:

actual: The actual class labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
predicted: The predicted class labels from the model.
Output
The function should return a tuple containing:

confusion_matrix: A 2x2 matrix.
accuracy: A float representing the accuracy of the model.
f1_score: A float representing the F1 score of the model.
specificity: A float representing the specificity of the model.
negative_predictive_value: A float representing the negative predictive value.
Constraints
All elements in the actual and predicted lists must be either 0 or 1.
Both lists must have the same length.
Example:
Input:
actual = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
predicted = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
print(performance_metrics(actual, predicted))
Output:
([[2, 1], [1, 1]], 0.6, 0.667, 0.5, 0.5)
Reasoning:
The function calculates the confusion matrix, accuracy, F1 score, specificity, and negative predictive value based on the input labels. The resulting values are rounded to three decimal places as required.
