Write a Python function to calculate the accuracy score of a model's predictions. The function should take in two 1D numpy arrays: y_true, which contains the true labels, and y_pred, which contains the predicted labels. It should return the accuracy score as a float.

Example:
Input:
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
    y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1])
    output = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    print(output)
Output:
# 0.8333333333333334
Reasoning:
The function compares the true labels with the predicted labels and calculates the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. In this example, there are 5 correct predictions out of 6, resulting in an accuracy score of 0.8333333333333334.
