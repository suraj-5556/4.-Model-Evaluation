Task: Compute the R-squared Value in Regression Analysis
R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure that indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable in a regression model.

Your Task: To implement the function r_squared(y_true, y_pred) that calculates the R-squared value, given arrays of true values y_true and predicted values y_pred.

Example:
Input:
import numpy as np

y_true = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y_pred = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2, 4.8])
print(r_squared(y_true, y_pred))
Output:
0.989
Reasoning:
The R-squared value is calculated to be 0.989, indicating that the regression model explains 98.9% of the variance in the dependent variable.
