Implement a function to generate train and test splits for K-Fold Cross-Validation. Your task is to divide the dataset into k folds and return a list of train-test indices for each fold.

Example:
Input:
k_fold_cross_validation(np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]), np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]), k=5, shuffle=False)
Output:
[([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1]), ([0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [2, 3]), ([0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9], [4, 5]), ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9], [6, 7]), ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9])]
Reasoning:
The function splits the dataset into 5 folds without shuffling and returns train-test splits for each iteration.
