Implement a function to calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between two arrays of actual and predicted values. The MAE is a metric used to measure the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction.

Example:
Input:
y_true = np.array([3, -0.5, 2, 7]), y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2, 8])
Output:
0.500
Reasoning:
The MAE is calculated by taking the mean of the absolute differences between the predicted and true values. Using the formula, the result is 0.500.
